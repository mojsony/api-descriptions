Key Resources

Reference API has four top level collection resources: countries, currencies, channels and banks.

Getting started tutorial
---------------
To get started follow these steps:
###1. Authenticate your app
Reference API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You get an access token that authenticates your app with a particular set of permissions for a user. You provide an access token through an HTTP header:
```
Authorization: bearer {token}
```
To obtain an access token and sign the user in, see [authentication](common-getstarted.html#authentication) section.

###2. URL Root
Now that you've authenticated your app, you can call the Reference API with your access token against the URL root below, combined with one of the root resources.  Reference API URLs are relative to the following root unless otherwise noted.

API | URL Root
--------|---------
Reference  | `https://bankapi.net/v1/reference`

> **Note**: Throughout this documentation, only partial syntax such as: 
`GET /places` is used for the sake of brevity. 
Prefix the path with the correct root URL in order to obtain the full resource path or URL.

###3. Get list of countries

You can do that at following endpoint:
```
GET /countries?page=1&page-size=3
```
