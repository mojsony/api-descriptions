<span class="icon">î«´</span>Case API Guide
=========================
Customer Case API gives you access to all cases that are associated with some customers and also create new ones.

Getting started tutorial
---------------
To get started follow these steps:
###1. Authenticate your app
Case API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You get an access token that authenticates your app with a particular set of permissions for a user. You provide an access token through an HTTP header:
```
Authorization: bearer {token}
```
To obtain an access token and sign the user in, see [authentication](common-getstarted.html#authentication) section.

###2. URL Root
Now that you've authenticated your app, you can call the Case API with your access token against the URL root below, combined with one of the root resources.  Case API URLs are relative to the following root unless otherwise noted.

API | URL Root
--------|---------
Case | `https://bankapi.net/v1/case`


> **Note**: Throughout this documentation, only partial syntax such as:
`GET /cases` is used for the sake of brevity.
Prefix the path with the correct root URL in order to obtain the full resource path or URL.


###3. Get list of all events
Operation returns list of cases with basic details like registration date current lifecycle state and the name and id of the agent responsible for handling the case. When used without optional parameters all active cases are returned.
To get the list of events you must get To create current account request

```
GET /cases
```

You will get back `200 OK` status code and the list of events. Note that every event in the list has link where you can navigate to see more details about that event.
