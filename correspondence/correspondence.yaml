  title: Correspondence API
  description: |
    Correspondence API handles the automated generation of batches of pre-formatted correspondence, typically integrating customer/product specific data in correspondence templates for variable aspects of content. Channel applications can use this API to deliver alerts, reminders, advices, past due notices, announcements, campaign offers, statements and other arrangement reports.
