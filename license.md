ASSECO REST API REFERENCE LICENSE
=================================

This license governs use of the application programming interface (API) definitions. If you use the API, you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the API.

##1. Definitions

The terms "reproduce," "reproduction" and "distribution" have the same meaning here as under EU copyright law.

"You" means the licensee of the API.

"Your company" means the company you worked for when you used API definitions.

"Reference use" means use of the API within your company as a reference, in read only form, for the sole purposes of evaluating future integration with Asseco applications, or enhancing the interoperability of your applications with Asseco software, and specifically excludes the right to distribute the API outside of your company.

##2. Grant of Rights

(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, the Licensor grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce the API for reference use.


##3. Limitations

(A) No Trademark License - This license does not grant you any rights to use the Licensor's name, logo, or trademarks.

(B) If you begin patent litigation against the Licensor over patents that you think may apply to the software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), your license to the API ends automatically.

(C) The API is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The Licensor gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the Licensor excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
