<span class="icon">î¢¸</span>Exchange API Guide
======================
Exchange API provides endpoints to initiate and track currency exchange orders, get one-time tailored offers for specific exchange deals and get latest and historic exchange rates and lists for reference and calculations.


> ##THIS API GUIDE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. COME BACK SOON.

Key Resources
-------------
Exchange API has four top-level resources: orders, offers, rates and lists.

Resource | Description
----------- |-----------
*orders*  | Exchange orders to buy or sell foreign currency
*offers* | One time offers of tailored rates for specific deals based on amount and customer standing in bank
*rates* | Currency exchange rates
*lists* | Latest and historical lists of exchange rates published by bank and central bank


Getting started tutorial
---------------
To get started follow these steps:
###1. Authenticate your app
Exchange API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You get an access token that authenticates your app with a particular set of permissions for a user. You provide an access token through an HTTP header:
```
Authorization: bearer {token}
```
To obtain an access token and sign the user in, see [authentication]() section.

###2. URL Root
Now that you've authenticated your app, you can call the Exchange API with your access token against the URL root below, combined with one of the root resources.  
Exchange API URLs are relative to the following root unless otherwise noted.

API | URL Root
--------|---------
Exchange | `https://bankapi.net/v1/exchange`

> **Note**: Throughout this documentation, only partial syntax such as:
`GET /transactions` is used for the sake of brevity.
Prefix the path with the correct root URL in order to obtain the full resource path or URL.


###3. Get transaction list


Before You can choose a transaction you can get transaction list for authenticated user.
```
GET /transactions
```
You will get back `200 OK` status code and json representation with a list of transactions.
```json
