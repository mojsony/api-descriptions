        x-asee-compliance: This should be the list of id-value pairs. I am not sure that this additionalProperties covers it well. Probably should be array type instead. Also, this list of values should be returned translated in the communication language set in customer profile.

    x-asee-compliance: The structure of this object is a bit awkward, but ok, I understand the problem. However, it would be nicer if instead of 6 there could be only one field, and the type of value stored in that field is already determined by kind of question.
