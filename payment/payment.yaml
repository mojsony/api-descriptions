    Payment API gives you possibility to create, update, delete and execute balance, credit and cross-border transfers. For each type of transfer there are three types of resources you can use. 
    Drafts for working with orders in process of preparation, archive for viewing processed orders and current for orders in process of execution.
    Orders can be authorized using action authorization API. Orders can be created and issued depending on a mandate that customer has on source account.
    Payment API gives you access to a repository of public and personal recipients and also gives you ability to create, update and delete order templates that can be used for fast creation of orders.
    In process of creating orders recipients can be identified by their account or alias associated with recipient in customer’s recipient registry.
    Aliases can be anything, from facebook identity, mobile phone number, e-mail address to a custom value defined by customer himself.
