          Enumeration which can be used by software to recognize the meaning of the activity that triggers the payment. For example, in combination with product type it can be used at front end as a resource id for row description translation into selected culture. Grouping multiple activities into single row is allowed, and then most appropriate classification should be used. For example, disbursement activity may include downpayment, fee-payment, and cash-collateral-pledging. Also repayment activity may include interest-payment, fee-payment, and cash-collateral-release. For deposit products, disbursement activity-kind is used to describe depositing activity, while repayment is used to describe withdrawal.
